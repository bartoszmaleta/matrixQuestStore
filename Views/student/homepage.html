                    Neo (born as Thomas A. Anderson, also known as The One, an anagram for Neo) is a fictional character
                    and
                    the protagonist of the Matrix franchise. He was portrayed as a cybercriminal and computer programmer
                    by
                    Keanu Reeves in The Matrix Trilogy, as well as having a cameo in The Animatrix short film Kid's
                    Story.
                    Andrew Bowen provided Neo's voice in The Matrix: Path of Neo. In 2008, Neo was selected by Empire as
                    the
                    68th Greatest Movie Character of All Time. Neo is also an anagram of "one", a reference to his
                    destiny
                    of being The One who would bring peace.There are claims that a nightclub in Chicago inspired the
                    name of
                    the character in the Matrix.
